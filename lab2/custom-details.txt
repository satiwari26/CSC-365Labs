//Country Data table
I have the Country Data table that contains the data of the country, it's population, Density, Net migration, Literacy %. This is useful to make
connection of each country's GDP and how population is affecting it.

//Global Food Price Data
This table contains information about the Global Price Data of the country, it contains country name, state name, price of food based on the region. The tables Country
attribute references the Country data table primary key which is Country.

//Food waste Data set
This table contains information about the food wastage table and houseHold estimate, Retail estimate etc. This is also useful when making connection with the country table.
This table also uses the country attribute as a Foreign key to make reference with country table - Country attribute.

I changed the primary key of the table since that change the uniquness of the table.
